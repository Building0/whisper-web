Follow SOLID principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle: A class or function should have one purpose only.
- Open/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Imagine a function that expects a Bird. You should be able to pass in a Sparrow or a Duck, and it should just work.
- Interface Segregation Principle: Don't make a big, fat interface with a bunch of unrelated methods. Instead, split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that classes only implement what they actually need.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: A design rule that says high-level code should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
